## Learning 2D game development with Pygame & Python
I'm following Clear Code's video to make this game and learn Pygame. You can watch it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY9MnQ4x3zk&t=306s).
It is a great video and making a 2D game has been so much fun! It has taught me a lot about programming and game development thinking.
I'd say that learning to make games without an engine but rather, doing it with code directly, is a good way to learn how to program.
Try making your own games without asking a LLM to make it for you, and see how it goes!
